This repository provides a **CTF walkthrough** for solving a challenge from the **Flagyard** platform. The challenge involves extracting QR codes hidden within frames of a video, decoding them, and decrypting the encrypted messages using ROT13. The tool is developed in Python and helps to automate the extraction, decoding, and decryption process.
